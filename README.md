Bike Sharing Prediction Model

Introduction

Data Analytics exists at the intersection of information technology, statistics, and business. Bike-sharing systems are a new generation 
of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental, and return has become automatic. The primary objective of 
this project is to perform Data Analysis and predict the number of bike rentals using various parameters such as day, season, month, hour, 
and holiday.

The proposed Bike Sharing Prediction Model aims to save time and resources for bike-sharing companies by accurately estimating the total 
number of users. This information can help them release an appropriate number of bikes into the market.
