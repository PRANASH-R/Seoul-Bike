Bike Sharing Prediction Model
Introduction
Data Analytics exists at the intersection of information technology, statistics, and business. Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental, and return has become automatic. The primary objective of this project is to perform Data Analysis and predict the number of bike rentals using various parameters such as day, season, month, hour, and holiday.

The proposed Bike Sharing Prediction Model aims to save time and resources for bike sharing companies by accurately estimating the total number of users. This information can help them release an appropriate number of bikes into the market.

Objectives
The main objective of this project is to predict the count of rented bikes based on the Seoul Bike Dataset. The dataset contains 8760 rows and 13 columns, capturing various factors that influence bike rentals. By analyzing this data, we aim to predict the number of rented bikes for each season, day, and hour.

Scope
The scope of this project includes the following:

Analyzing the Seoul Bike Dataset.
Predicting the count of rented bikes based on factors such as season, day, and hour.
Utilizing tools such as NUMPY, PANDAS, Matplotlib, and Linear Regression Algorithms.
Implementing the project in Jupyter Notebook.
